### Title

react-portfolio

### Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
This Portfolio was build using React.js. It has a header and footer component that appears on multiple pages. In addition, there is a single Project component that is reused multiple times on the same page. Navigation is done via a Router. This was very challenging activity and really helped me get a greater understanding of how React.js works.
