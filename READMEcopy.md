### Description

This is a MERN stack application.  The app was designed for a local pool service, where the user wanted to have access to their customers online and have a polished, user friendly UI.  The user also wanted all CRUD API functionality. The user is able to create an account, login, view all customers, select a customer to view and update as needed. The customer view supports a Google map API of the customer’s address. The user can also add a new customer, or delete and existing one. If the customer address is updated, the Google map is updated with the new location.
